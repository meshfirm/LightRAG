PROMPTS["entity_extraction"] = """---Goal---
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
Use {language} as output language.

---Entity Type Descriptions---
Here are descriptions of each entity type to help with accurate identification:

- organisation: A company, corporation, business entity, or larger organizational unit. It must be the name of a specific company. Examples: Microsoft, Tesla, Government Agency.
- team: A group of individuals working together on specific objectives within an organization. It must be the name of a specific team. Examples: Design Team, Marketing Team, Development Team.
- team member: An individual person who belongs to a team, with specific roles and responsibilities. It must be the name of a specific person or role. Examples: Product Manager, Developer, Designer.
- customer: An individual person that purchases or uses products/services. It must be the name of a specific person or role. Examples: Thomas Bach, Product Manager at Microsoft.
- product: A tangible or digital offering created to meet user needs. It must be the name of a specific product or service. Examples: Mobile App, Cloud Service, Hardware Device.
- feature: A distinct capability or component of a product. It must be the name of a specific feature or component. Examples: User Authentication, Export Functionality, Dashboard.
- insight: A meaningful understanding gained from data, feedback, or observation. Examples: User Pain Point, Market Trend, Usage Pattern.
- decision: A choice or determination made in the product development process. Examples: Feature Prioritization, Design Direction, Go-to-Market Strategy.
- document: A written or digital record containing information. Examples: Requirements Specification, Design Brief, Meeting Notes.
- event: A significant occurrence or milestone. Examples: Product Launch, Review Meeting, User Testing Session.
- metric: A quantifiable measure used to track performance. Examples: User Engagement, Revenue Growth, Development Velocity.
- timeline: A scheduled sequence of tasks, milestones, or deliverables. Examples: Roadmap, Release Schedule, Sprint Plan.

---Steps---
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name.
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.
Format the content-level key words as ("content_keywords"{tuple_delimiter}<high_level_keywords>)

4. Return output in {language} as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

The Product Development Team at TechNova Inc. held their weekly sprint review yesterday, where Sarah Chen, the lead product manager, presented findings from recent user testing sessions. Enterprise customer Acme Financial had reported difficulties with the dashboard export functionality in the company's flagship analytics platform, DataInsight Pro.

"The CSV export feature is causing 30-second delays when users try to download large datasets," Sarah explained, sharing her screen with detailed error logs. "Our customer satisfaction score for this feature has dropped from 8.2 to 6.5 in the last quarter."

The Engineering Team, represented by Dev Lead Alex Rodriguez, acknowledged the issue and proposed a solution involving database query optimization. After some discussion, the team decided to prioritize this fix for the next sprint cycle, aiming to reduce export times by at least 70%.

This decision was documented in the Sprint Planning Document, which outlines all development priorities for the upcoming two-week sprint. The Product Roadmap was also updated to reflect this change, with the improved export functionality scheduled for release in the v3.2 update next month.

The Marketing Team will measure the success of this initiative using the System Performance Index and Customer Satisfaction scores after the next release.

GlobalSoft Solutions' Executive Team convened for the Q3 Strategic Planning Meeting last Tuesday. CEO Jennifer Park opened by highlighting a concerning trend from the latest Market Penetration Report: their enterprise collaboration tool, WorkStream, was losing market share to competitors offering better mobile experiences.

The Customer Research Team, led by Marcus Washington, presented insights from recent interviews with key clients like Meridian Healthcare and BlueSky Retail. "82% of enterprise users now consider mobile access critical, compared to just 47% last year," Marcus explained. "Our app's user engagement score is 3.6/10, well below industry average of 7.2."

CTO Raj Patel and his Mobile Development Team proposed an aggressive redesign of the WorkStream mobile app, focusing on offline functionality and push notifications—two features frequently requested in customer feedback.

After thorough discussion, the leadership team decided to allocate additional resources to mobile development, targeting a complete app redesign for Q1 next year. This decision was documented in the updated Product Strategy Document and Annual Investment Plan.

The project will follow an accelerated timeline, with design completion by November 15th, development by February 1st, and public release by March 20th. Success will be measured primarily through the Mobile User Satisfaction Index and app engagement metrics, with a target of 40% improvement in both areas within two months of release.

During yesterday's User Feedback Session, NovaTech's Product Team gathered input from beta users of their SmartTask project management application. Lead Designer Emma Rodriguez demonstrated the new Task Dependencies Feature, which allows users to create visual workflows between related tasks.

FutureWorks Inc., a midsize marketing agency and pilot customer, provided valuable feedback through their Project Director, David Chen. "The dependency visualization is powerful, but we need the ability to set conditional dependencies based on task status," Chen explained.

This insight resonated with findings from the recent Customer Needs Assessment, which identified advanced dependency management as a top request among enterprise users. After the session, Product Owner Jason Kim and the Development Team conducted a quick analysis and determined that implementing conditional dependencies would require approximately three weeks of development time.

In the Post-Session Debrief, the team decided to add this enhancement to the Q2 Development Roadmap, targeting inclusion in the 3.5 release. This decision was recorded in the Product Requirements Document, along with specific user stories and acceptance criteria.

Success will be measured using the Feature Adoption Rate and the Task Management Efficiency Score, with a baseline to be established immediately after release.

MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

---Remember Steps---

1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name.
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.
Format the content-level key words as ("content_keywords"{tuple_delimiter}<high_level_keywords>)

4. Return output in {language} as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

You are a helpful assistant tasked with identifying both high-level and low-level keywords in the user's query and conversation history.

---Goal---

Given the query and conversation history, list both high-level and low-level keywords. High-level keywords focus on overarching concepts or themes, while low-level keywords focus on specific entities, details, or concrete terms.

---Instructions---

- Consider both the current query and relevant conversation history when extracting keywords
- Output the keywords in JSON format, it will be parsed by a JSON parser, do not add any extra content in output
- The JSON should have two keys:
  - "high_level_keywords" for overarching concepts or themes
